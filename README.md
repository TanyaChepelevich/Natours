# Natours project

Natours is a website, unlike a landing page, for a fictional company that offers tours in the nature, so Na-tours.

**The focus of this project is on using modern CSS properties and techniques**: clips, transforms, animations, background video, etc.


The layout is buils using a **float based custom grid**. 

 - Even though Flexbox and CSS Grid are more modern layout approaches, every web developer still needs to know exactly how float layouts work.

- A professional developer's job will include working with older CSS codebases, which will contain float layouts.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- SASS (SCSS syntax)
- CSS
- float Layout
- Responsive design

### What I learned

- How and why to use *rem* units in our project;
- A great workflow for converting *px* to *rem*.  
- How to use the BEM method in practice.
- How to clip parts of elements using *clip-path*.
- How to create CSS animations using 
*@keyframes* and the *animation* property.
- The easiest way to center anything with the 
transform, top and left properties.
``` CSS
{
        position: absolute;
        top: 50%;
        left: 50%;
        transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    }
```

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
